Where to Start my Dog Walking Business?

Introduction
----------------------------------
A client wants to start a dog walking business in Toronto and has asked for advice about where it should be located.

Ideally we want to target an area with a large number of pets, as well as places to walk them.  
To do this analysis, we will use the following information:
- The number of pets in each neighborhood in Toronto.
- The neighborhood name.
- The population of each each neighborhood.
- The Foursquare API to retrieve the number of appropriate venues for walking dogs (trails, parks and dog runs).

Using the above information, we will
- Cluster neighborhoods to find areas with a relatively high number of pet licenses and high number of dog related venues.
- Compare pet licenses from 2013 to 2017 to get an idea of which FSAs are showing a growth in pets.
- Look at the proportion of pets/population in each neighborhood.

Data Sources
----------------------------------
Population by FSA from Census 2016: https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/hlt-fst/pd-pl/comprehensive.cfm
 - This information will be used to calculate the proportion of pet ownership in each neighborhood of Toronto.
 - We will use the 3 columns: FSA, Province and Population, 2016.
 
Toronto Open Data: Licensed Dogs and Cats Reports for 2013 through 2017 https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/open-data/open-data-catalogue/community-services/#a666d03a-bafe-943a-e256-3c2d14b07b10
- This data has four columns: FSA / # Cat Licenses Issued / # Dog Licenses Issued / Total Licenses.

FourSquare Api: 
- We will query to get the number of places to walk a dog per neighborhood in Toronto.
- Specifically, this query will be filtered to look for only the following category Ids:
Dog Run 4bf58dd8d48988d1e5941735
Park 4bf58dd8d48988d163941735
Trail 4bf58dd8d48988d159941735
- A sample query looks like this:
https://api.foursquare.com/v2/venues/explore?client_id=<id>&client_secret=<secret>E&v=X&ll=43.642960,-79.371613
&radius=400&limit=100&categoryId=4bf58dd8d48988d1e5941735,4bf58dd8d48988d163941735,4bf58dd8d48988d159941735

geopy: 
- We will use this to get coordinates for each FSA, for use when calling the Foursquare API.

Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M
- We will use this to get the neighborhood name for each FSA.
