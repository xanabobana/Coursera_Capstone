<h1>Where to Start my Dog Walking Business?</h1>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>

Problem: A client wants to start a dog walking business in Seattle and has asked for advice about where it should be located.

Ideally we want to target an area with a large number of pets, as well as places to walk them.  
To do this analysis, we will use the following information:
- the number of pets in each neighborhood in Toronto
- the neighborhood name 
- the population of each each neighborhood from the 2016 census
- the foursquare api to retrieve the number of appropriate venues for walking dogs (trails, parks and dog runs)

Using the above information, we will
- cluster neighborhoods to find areas with a relatively high number of pet licenses and high number of dog related venues
- compare pet licenses from 2013 to 2017 to get an idea of which FSAs are showing a growth in pets
- look at the proportion of pets/population in each neighborhood

<h2>2. Data Sources</h2>

Data used in this project
---------------------------------
Population by FSA from Census 2016: https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/hlt-fst/pd-pl/comprehensive.cfm
 - this information will be used to calculate the proportion of pet ownership 
 - this data set has 3 columns of interest: FSA / Province / Population, 2016
 - We will filter this data set to only include the FSAs located in Toronto
 
Toronto Open Data: Licensed Dogs and Cats Reports for 2013 through 2017 https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/open-data/open-data-catalogue/community-services/#a666d03a-bafe-943a-e256-3c2d14b07b10
- this data has four columns: FSA / # Cat Licenses Issued / # Dog Licenses Issued / Total Licenses

FourSquare Api: 
* to get number of places to walk a dog per neighborhood
* specifically, this query will be filtered to look for only the following categoryIds:
Dog Run 4bf58dd8d48988d1e5941735
Park 4bf58dd8d48988d163941735
Trail 4bf58dd8d48988d159941735

* a sample query looks like this:
https://api.foursquare.com/v2/venues/explore?client_id=<id>&client_secret=<secret>E&v=X&ll=43.642960,-79.371613
&radius=400&limit=100&categoryId=4bf58dd8d48988d1e5941735,4bf58dd8d48988d163941735,4bf58dd8d48988d159941735

geopy: 
* to get lat/long coordinates for each FSA, which is used when calling Foursquare API for each FSA

Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M
* to get neighborhood names for each FSA
